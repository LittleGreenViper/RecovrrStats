The file is a "snapshot" log of a system that has users logging in, and the snapshots are taken every 12 hours, at midnight (00:00:00), and noon (12:00:00).

Users can have a location (long/lat), associated with their account. It is possible for them to not select a location. If they do have a location, it is possible for them to hide their location from other users.

All of our statistics are anonymized and aggregated. Every 12 hours, a new row is appended to the end of the CSV file.

The system has a "gatekeeper" administrator, that reviews and approves (or rejects) signup requests.

Unless a signup is approved, the user cannot log in, so these are the following basic states for users (or potential users) of the system:

    1) Open Signup Request
    
        A potential user has requested an account for the system, and a signup request has been added to the end of a queue. An administrator must either approve or reject the signup request.
    
    2) Approved Signup Request
    
        An administrator has approved a signup request. This means that a new user has been added to the system, and the request has been removed from the signup request queue.
    
    3) Rejected Signup Request
    
        An administrator has rejected a signup request. The request is removed from the signup request queue, and no new user is added to the system.
    
    4) New User
    
        This is a new user that has been created in response to an approved signup request. The user has not yet logged into the system, but has been sent an email, with their login details.
    
        A new user has 30 days from approval, to log in. Otherwise, their account may be deleted by an administrator.
    
    5) Active User
    
        This is a user that has logged in at least once, after approval. We keep track of their last login.
    
        An active user must log in once a year (or more frequently). Otherwise, their account may be deleted by an administrator.
    
        Active users can delete their own accounts, which completely removes them from the system. We do not track these deletions, but they can be inferred, from the totals in the file.

The column legend for the file is:

    sample_date
    
        This is the date the sample was taken, in UNIX Epoch Time (Seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00).
    
    total_users
    
        This is the current total of active and new users on the system. This does not include signup requests. It is a current (non-cumulative) total.
    
    new_users
    
        This is the current total of new users on the system. It is a current (non-cumulative) total.
    
        It does not include signup requests. New users have had their signup request approved, but have never logged in, since having it approved.
    
        NOTE: In order to calculate active users (users that have logged in, at least once), simply subtract new_users from total_users.
    
    never_set_location
    
        This is the current total of users (both active and new) that have never set a location. It is a current (non-cumulative) total.
        
        This is different from hiding their location. In this case, there is no location at all. 
    
    total_requests
    
        This is the total number of requests for signups (open, approved, or rejected). It is a cumulative total.
    
    accepted_requests
    
        This is the total number of requests for signups That have been approved by an administrator. It is a cumulative total.
    
    rejected_requests
    
        This is the total number of requests for signups That have been rejected by an administrator. It is a cumulative total.
    
    open_requests
    
        This is the current (non-cumulative) total of signup requests that exist on the signup request queue (have yet to be addressed by an administrator).
    
    active_1
    
        This is the total number of active users that have logged in at least once, within the last 24 hours.
    
    active_7
    
        This is the total number of active users that have logged in at least once, within the last 7 days.
    
    active_30
    
        This is the total number of active users that have logged in at least once, within the last 30 days.
    
    active_90
    
        This is the total number of active users that have logged in at least once, within the last 90 days.
    
    active_avg
    
        This is a simple average of the time since last login, for active users (in days).
    
    deleted_active
    
        This is the cumulative total of active users that have been explicitly deleted by an administrator.
    
    deleted_inactive
    
        This is the cumulative total of new users that have been explicitly deleted by an administrator.
