Given a comma-separated-values file, with a fixed number of colums, and a variable number of rows, I would like some data analysis.

The file is a "snapshot" log of a system that has users logging in, and the snapshots are taken every 12 hours, at midnight (00:00:00), and noon (12:00:00).

The system has a "gatekeeper" that approves signup requests. Unless a signup is approved, the user cannot log in, so there are the following basic states for users (or potential users) of the system:

1) Open Signup Request

A potential user has requested an account for the system, and a signup request has been added to the end of a queue. An administrator must either approve or reject the signup request.

2) Approved Signup Request

An administrator has approved a signup request. This means that a new user has been added to the system, and the request has been removed from the signup request queue.

3) Rejected Signup Request

An administrator has rejected a signup request. The request is removed from the signup request queue, and no new user is added to the system.

4) New User

This is a new user that has been created in response to an approved signup request. The user has not yet logged into the system.

A new user has 30 days from approval, to log in. Otherwise, their account may be deleted by an administrator.

5) Active User

This is a user that has logged in. We keep track of their last login.

An active user must log in once a year (or more frequently). Otherwise, their account may be deleted by an administrator.

Users can have a location (long/lat), associated with their account. It is possible for them to not select a location. If they do have a location, it is possible for them to hide their location from other users.

Active users can delete their accounts, which completely removes them from the system.

All of our statistics are anonymized and aggregated. Every 12 hours, a new row is appended to the end of the CSV file.

The column legend for the file is:

sample_date

This is the date the sample was taken, in UNIX Epoch Time (Seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00).

total_users

This is the current total of active and new users on the system. It does not include signup requests.

new_users

never_set_location

This is the current total of users (both active and new) that have never set a location.

total_requests

This is the total number of requests for signups (open, approved, or rejected). It is a cumulative total.
